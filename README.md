#Conjugate App
Track you hour homework by connecting you Gogle calendar to Cojugate. Once your class is done, you'll get a notification asking you if you had homework assigned. If you hit yes, you will be prompted for all the information we need (Title and due date) right in the notification bar. 

If you forget to add hw for a class, Conjugate will match you with other people from your class and suggest you to add homework if you haven't already.

To view your homework, just open the app or wait for a notification close to the due date.
